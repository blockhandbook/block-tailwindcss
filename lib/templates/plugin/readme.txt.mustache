For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

You can find all the markdown syntax here:
<https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>

== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above. This may be of use for extremely complicated

"installation." Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.
